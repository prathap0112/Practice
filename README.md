# Practice

This repository contains my personal practice projects for web development, focusing on pure HTML as well as HTML + CSS. The purpose is to track my learning progress, experiment with different techniques, and showcase my work.

## Structure

- **/pure-html-projects/**  
  Projects that use only HTML.

- **/html-css-projects/**  
  Projects that use both HTML and CSS.

Each folder contains individual subfolders for each project.

## How to View Projects

You can open the HTML files directly in your browser, or clone the repository and navigate into each project folder to view or modify the code.
